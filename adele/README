                       Extended Example for G4GeneralParticleSource (GPS)
                       --------------------------------------- 

  exgps is created to demonstrate the usage of G4GeneralParticleSource for generating 
  primary incident particle according to user defined distributions. These range from simple 
  monocromatic point source to complicated mutiple sources with various biasing schemes. 
  
  More detailed information on the usage of GPS are available on its home site:

  1. GEOMETRY

     Simple geometry consists of a "Vacuum" world and, in it with two other components:	     
 
       - An alunimium box : 20 x 20 x 20 cm in size, cerntered at the origin.
		  
       - A SiO2 sphere: 5 cm in radius and is placed in the centre of the aluminium box. 

  2. PHYSICS

	Tranportation process only for all particles.

  3. EVENT:

     The event generator is the G4GeneralParticleSource (GPS). The instantiation of G4GeneralParticleSource
     is same as that for G4ParticleGun. See the exGPSPrimaryGeneratorAction.cc file for details .  
  
  5. VISUALIZATION:
 
     Visualisation of the geometry and the tracks is possible with many of the G4 visualisation packages. An
     example of displaying the geometry and tracks using VRML is given in the macro file vis.mac.  

  6. ANALYSIS:

     This example implements an AIDA-compliant analysis manager which creates histograms and ntuples. 
     If user has an AIDA-compliant tool such as AIDAJNI, ANAPHE, OpenScientist or PI installed on his/her system. Some URLs :
       http://aida.freehep.org/
       http://java.freehep.org/aidajni
       http://www.cern.ch/PI   
       http://OpenScientist.lal.in2p3.fr
 
     The analysis part of this example can be activated by doing a "source 
     aida-setup" of the AIDA compliant tool (to activate the aida-config
     program) and by raising some environment variabless so that the 
     G4 GNUmakefile system can take into account the AIDA tool.
     This can be done, for example on a UNIX under a csh like shell, with : 
        csh> source <path_where_the_AIDA_tool_is_installed>/aida-setup.csh
        csh> aida-config # to check that this program is up and running
     G4 related part :
	csh> setenv G4ANALYSIS_USE 1
	csh> setenv G4ANALYSIS_AIDA_CONFIG_CFLAGS `aida-config --include`
        csh> setenv G4ANALYSIS_AIDA_CONFIG_LIBS `aida-config --lib`

     (It may be usefull to note that in the G4 GNUmakefile system,
     the upper variables are used in the file config/analysis.gmk).

     This needs to be done before building the executable.  

     At the end of an excution, an xml file "exgps.aida" is created by default which contains 
     histograms and ntuples. User can change the name and format of this output file with the commands
	
	/analysis/filetype new-type
	/analysis/fileName new-filename

	e.g.

	/analysis/filetype root
	/analysis/filename myfile.root 

     these change the output file format to ROOT and output file name to "myfile.root". There are three file 
     formats to choose from: xml, root or hbook.

     The output file conatins 6 histograms and one ntuple:

	histogram 1: The energy spectrum of the primary particles.
	histogram 2: 2d histogram of primary particle incident position distribution in the X-Y plane.
	histogram 3: 2d histogram of primary particle incident position distribution in the X-Z plane.
	histogram 4: 2d histogram of primary particle incident position distribution in the Y-Z plane.
	histogram 5: 2d histogram of primary particle incident angle distribution in terms of Phi/Cos(Theta).
	histogram 6: 2d histogram of primary particle incident angle distribution in terms of Phi/Theta.

     The binnings of the histograms can be changed with the UI commands avialable under the 
     /analysis directory.
 
     In the ntuple the following data are recorded for each incident particle:  

	Particle ID
	Incident Position (x,y,z);
	Incident Angle (theta,phi);
	Particle weight;

  7. GETTING STARTED:

     i) If you have an AIDA-compliant analysis package installed, then you should switch on the analysis 
     part of the example by: 

	setenv G4ANALYSIS_USE 1
     
     otherwise do  
  
	unsetenv G4ANALYSIS_USE

     to remove the generation of an output file.
 
     ii) Build the exgps executable:

         cd to exgps
         gmake clean
         gmake

     gmake will create tmp and bin directories in your $G4TMP and $G4BIN directories. 
     The executable, named exgps, will be created in the $G4BIN/$G4SYSTEM/ directory.

     iii) Run the executable: 

     while in the exgps directory do 

         $G4BIN/$G4SYSTEM/exgps exrgps.in

     If G4ANALYSIS_USE is defined, and dpends on the particular AIDA system used, e.g. JAIDA, one could see 
     a display window of the six histograms. It may be neccessary to close the plotter window in order to 
     terminate the execution. After the termination one will find the "exgps.aida", as well as a vrml file 
     "g4_00.wrl" in the directory.

 8. FURTHER EXAMPLES of MACRO FILES:

    There are a number of g4mac files in the ./macros subdirectory, to show the various features of GPS. 
    Most of them will lead to the creation of an aida file in the same name as the macro file. 
    These aida files can be examed and analysed with an analysis tool such as JAS3.
